    "# Guided Project: Mobile App for Lottery Addiction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will contribute together to the development of a mobile app that is meant to help lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people start playing the lottery for fun, but for some this activity turns into a habit which eventually escalates into addiction. Like other compulsive gamblers, lottery addicts soon begin spending from their savings and loans, they start to accumulate debts, and eventually engage in desperate behaviors like theft.\n",
    "\n",
    "A medical institute that aims to prevent and treat gambling addictions wants to build a dedicated mobile app to help lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning. The institute has a team of engineers that will build the app, but they need us to create the logical core of the app and calculate probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first version of the app, they want us to focus on the [6/49](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotto_6/49) lottery and build functions that enable users to answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?\n",
    "- What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?\n",
    "\n",
    "The institute also wants us to consider historical data coming from the national 6/49 lottery game in Canada. The [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datascienceai/lottery-dataset) has data for 3,665 drawings, dating from 1982 to 2018 (we'll come back to this).\n",
    "\n",

    "## One-ticket Winning Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 6/49 lottery, six numbers are drawn from a set of 49 numbers that range from 1 to 49. A player wins the big prize if the six numbers on their tickets match all the six numbers drawn. If a player has a ticket with the numbers {13, 22, 24, 27, 42, 44}, he only wins the big prize if the numbers drawn are {13, 22, 24, 27, 42, 44}. If only one number differs, he doesn't win.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first version of the app, we want players to be able to calculate the probability of winning the big prize with the various numbers they play on a single ticket (for each ticket a player chooses six numbers out of 49). So, we'll start by building a function that calculates the probability of winning the big prize for any given ticket.\n",
    "\n",
    "We discussed with the engineering team of the medical institute, and they told us we need to be aware of the following details when we write the function:\n",
    "- Inside the app, the user inputs six different numbers from 1 to 49.\n",
    "- Under the hood, the six numbers will come as a Python list, which will serve as the single input to our function.\n",
    "- The engineering team wants the function to print the probability value in a friendly way — in a way that people without any probability training are able to understand."
